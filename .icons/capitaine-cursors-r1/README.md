# Capitaine cursors
This is an x-cursor theme inspired by macOS and based on KDE Breeze. It was created with Inkscape and xcursorgen, and was designed to pair well with my icon pack, ![La Capitaine](https://github.com/keeferrourke/la-capitaine-icon-theme).

## License
Capitaine cursors is based on KDE Breeze cursors, as such it falls under the same license.
Capitaine cursors is LGPLv3. See COPYING for more details.

## Building
You'll find everything you need to build and modify this cursor set in this repository. To build the cursor set from the PNG source run:

    ./build.sh

to generate the pixmaps and appropriate aliases.

The PNGs were exported directly from the SVGs in Inkscape, though I plan to modify the build script to automate this process in the next release.
