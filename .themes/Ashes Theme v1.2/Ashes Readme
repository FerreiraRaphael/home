--------- Installation:

Extract it and copy "Ashes" folder to the theme directory.
    
    For system-wide installation to /usr/share/themes
    For user-specific installation to ~/.themes

Use gnome-tweak-tool to change the theme.



------- Enable DARK titlebars/headerbars 

Turn on (enable) "Global Dark Theme" using Gnome-tweak-tool.
(Look at the mouse sursor in last screenshot)

Then logout and login to take effect.


*** Turn off Global Dark Theme, then logout and login to come back to white color title bars.



---------- Install GDM (Lock/Login Screen) theme



To change the GDM theme, you need to rewrite a system file.
Please be careful because if it fails, desktop environment may not operate correctly.

Notes:
Not supported for GNOME 3.14, sorry.
When applying this, other shell themes might look broken.

Install

* Backup an existing .gresource file. (Skip this step when you just update it.)

sudo cp /usr/share/gnome-shell/gnome-shell-theme.gresource /usr/share/gnome-shell/gnome-shell-theme.gresource~

* Replace with the new one.

*** If you put this theme in /usr/share/themes:

sudo cp /usr/share/themes/Ashes/gnome-shell/gnome-shell-theme.gresource /usr/share/gnome-shell

*** If you put this theme in ~/.themes:

sudo cp ~/.themes/Ashes/gnome-shell/gnome-shell-theme.gresource /usr/share/gnome-shell

Restart GNOME Shell (press Alt+F2, then type r).

Uninstall

* Restore to original theme from the backup.

sudo mv -f /usr/share/gnome-shell/gnome-shell-theme.gresource~ /usr/share/gnome-shell/gnome-shell-theme.gresource

Restart GNOME Shell (press Alt+F2, then type r).
